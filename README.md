# My-Data-Science-Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of data science projects, which I have completed for academic, self-learning, and hobby purposes. This repository showcases my skills and knowledge in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling.


**Time Series Forecasting**
[Residual Energy Forecasting](https://github.com/manasisuryavanshi99/Energy-Forecasting): A multivariate time series analysis for predicting residual loads, which is crucial for maintaining a stable energy supply. The complexities arise due to weather-dependent generation, making accurate forecasts essential for proper supply operations.
**Dataset:** Part of a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/energy-forecasting-data-challenge) 
**Models explored:** ARIMA, VAR(Vector Autoregression) and Facebook Prophet
